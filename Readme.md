## Why OOPs is needed?
- Better maintainability
- Reusability of code through inheritance
- Encapsulation for better data security
- Easier to manage and debug complex systems

## OOP Principles

# In python, the object holds all the values even the data type. 

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, typically a class. This helps in protecting the data from outside interference and misuse.

2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions, making it easier to manage and extend.

4. **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

## Class and Objects in Memory Management

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. When an object is created, Python allocates memory for the object and its attributes. Each object has a unique memory address. Python uses a dynamic memory allocation system and garbage collection to manage memory efficiently.

When you pass an object to a function, it is passed by reference, meaning the function receives a reference to the original object, not a copy. This allows the function to modify the object's attributes directly, reflecting changes outside the function scope.
